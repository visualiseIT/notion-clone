## Publish Component

The `Publish` component is a powerful feature that enhances collaboration by allowing users to share specific notes with others while providing control over their visibility. It seamlessly integrates into your note components, providing a straightforward way to make your content accessible on the web.

### Features

- **Publish:** Share your notes with a wider audience by making them live on the web. This feature is perfect for showcasing your work, collaborating with team members, or sharing information with others.

- **Unpublish:** Maintain control over your content accessibility. When you no longer want a note to be public, simply use the "Unpublish" feature to disable access. This is useful for maintaining privacy or restricting access after sharing.

- **Copy URL:** Share your live note effortlessly by copying its URL. The "Copy URL" feature streamlines the process of sharing your content with others, ensuring quick and easy dissemination.

- **Status Indicator:** Stay informed about the publication status of your notes through a visual indicator. Whether a note is published or unpublished, the `Publish` component provides a clear status indicator for at-a-glance awareness.

## Custom Hooks

- **UseHooks-ts:** Leverage a collection of custom React hooks written in TypeScript for enhanced functionality.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
# backend for local
npx convex dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
